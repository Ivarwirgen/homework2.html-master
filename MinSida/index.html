    <div class="text-box">
      Project CARS isn’t for everybody. It’s a serious, deep, and demanding
      racing simulation for people who like their motorsport pure. There’s no
      pop punk soundtrack, or explosive takedowns, or generous rewinds.
      Developer Slightly Mad Studios set out to capture the experience of
      manhandling a real racing car around a long list of some of the world’s
      most famous racing circuits, and has thoroughly succeeded. ' Tough but
      satisfying and cruel but fair, Project CARS is a truly fantastic racing
      game with the potential to become a real force in the genre.

    <div class="text-box">
      In order to play Projet cars you have to use either a controller or a
      racing wheel. Sim racing isn´t a cheap hobby, if you want a decent racing
      wheel you have to pay around 350$ but there are cheaper options. Such as 
      logitech G29 (on the left) which is one of the most common racing wheels becasue of it's 
      entry level price of 250$ or Thrustmaster T150rs PRO (on the right) which will cost you 320$.
      The main reason there is a such a big difference in prices is in three factors, <Br></Br>
       1. Quality,
      <Br>2. Forcefeedback and type of force feedback</Br> 
      3. Pedals

    <h2 class="text-heading">Quality</h2>
    <div class="text-box">
      One of the main reasons to the drastic price change is the quality of the racing wheels. For example a Racing wheel like Logitech G29 has way more plastic bits than a FANATECH wheel wich is 
      one of the most expensive brands on racing wheels on the market right now. There could also be
      leather on the wheel which makes it cost more and so on the more metal and aluminum the more the wheel costs.
    </div>
    <h2 class="text-heading">Forcefeedback</h2>
    <div class="text-box">
      Many racing wheels have force feedback capability to provide a more immersive and challenging driving experience.
       Racing wheels that support force feedback are typically equipped with a single motor that applies force to the steering wheel along a single axis, the axis of wheel rotation.
       There is three differnt kinds of force feedback Gear driven which is the cheapest and most common kind of force feedback
       where the force comes from gears that pull on the wheel. There is also belt driven which is a belt that applies force on the racing wheel,
       belt driven is still considered a cheap option just a different one from gear this kind is smoother than gears.
       And lastly there is direct drive Racing wheels, In a direct drive system, the steering wheel is directly coupled to the motor shaft. There are no gears or belts. Direct Drive wheels typically use larger motors to compensate for their lack of belts.
